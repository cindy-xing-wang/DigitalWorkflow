## Digital Workflow

This a full-stack web app using Laravel8, MySQL. I used MVC architecture to build this project. The Laravel UI will handle the authentication feature and I used a theme kit for the UI mockup. The main features of this app are role, checklist management, creating a new operation, calendars, health and safety reporting. The demo project is deployed on Heroku. Feel free to log in as admin/sub-admin/staff to have a look at [the app](http://digitalworkflow.herokuapp.com/)(Quick Login provided).
